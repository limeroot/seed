The Limeroot core

Limeroot is based on Debian 6 squeeze using a custom 3.3.6 kernel; this is the base system, you can clone it to chroot in
it to compile stuff for Limeroot, You'll need to install gcc, automake, etc... in it using apt-get or aptitude in order to 
compile anything for Limeroot.

Have fun ;)
